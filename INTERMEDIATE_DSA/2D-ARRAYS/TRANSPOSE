Given mat[n][n], calculate transpose of the matrix without extra space.

Transpose->
0th row -> 0th col
1st row -> 1st col
2nd row -> 2nd col
.
.
.
nth row -> nth col

For e.g:

2 3 4 5                    2  3  5  9                  
3 4 5 6    ------------->  3  4  6  2
5 6 7 8                    4  5  7  1
9 2 1 3                    5  6  8  3


If you observe the diagonals remain the same in original matrix and the transpose matrix
