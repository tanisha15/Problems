Problem Description
You are given a matrix A, you have to return an array containing sum of each row elements followed by sum of each column elements of the matrix.

NOTE: If the matrix given is of size (N x M), then the array you return would be of size (N + M), where first N elements contain the sum of each N rows, and the next M elements contain the sum of each M columns.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A.size() <= 1000

1 <= A[i].size() <= 1000

1 <= A[i][j] <= 1000



Input Format
First argument is a 2D matrix of integers.



Output Format
You have to return a 1D list of integers after doing required operations.
