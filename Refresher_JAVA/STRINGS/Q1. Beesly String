Problem Description
Mr. Jim likes playing with strings a lot, so Mrs. Pam gifted him a string A which has some very unique magical powers. The string consists of lowercase latin letters 'p','a' and 'm' only.

In one wish, Mr Jim can perform one of the following operations:
Remove exactly one occurrence of 'p' and exactly one occurrence of 'm', from anywhere inside string A.
Remove exactly one occurrence of 'a' and exactly one occurrence of 'm', from anywhere inside string A.
Now Mr. Jim wants to know if after some number of wishes is it possible to make string A empty.

Return 1 if it is possible to make string A empty after some number of operations otherwise Return 0.


Problem Constraints
1 ≤ |A| ≤ 105


Input Format
The first argument is a string, A.



Output Format
Return 1, if it is possible to make string A empty. Otherwise return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = "mpampamm"    
A = "pampampam"    


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
 0

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

We can reduce the string to null in the following sequence of steps:
1) mpampamm : initial state
2) mampam   : removing 2nd and 8th character
3) mpam     : removing 1st and 2nd character
4) am       : removing 1st and 2nd character
5)          : removing 1st and 2nd character
So the answer is 1.
Explanation 2:

It is not possible to empty the string using any sequence of steps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logic: There are only p,a and m's. The string will be an empty string if you remove-> 'a' and 'm' for every occurence and then 'p' and 'm' for every ocuurence. 
This means that in the string for every 'a' there should be a 'm' and for every 'p' there should be a 'm' for the string to be empty.
This means count of a + count of p = count of m

        int ac=0;
        int mc=0;
        for(int i=0;i<l;i++){
            char ch=A.charAt(i);
            if(ch=='p'){
                pc++;
            }
            else if (ch=='a'){
                ac++;
            }
            else{
                mc++;
            }
        }
       if (ac+pc==mc){
           return 1;
       }
        return 0;
    }
}
